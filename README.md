# PROSPACE: Satellite Image Analysis


In our project focused on analyzing satellite images, we began by preprocessing the data, which involved examining the characteristics of the images. Through this analysis, we discovered that the images typically measured around 4 units in width and 36 units in both height and depth.

Once we had a clear understanding of the data, we transformed the image data into tensors, a format suitable for deep learning analysis. This conversion enabled us to leverage advanced modeling techniques, particularly a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) combined with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

The VAE-CNN model served a dual purpose: compressing the high-dimensional image data into a more manageable latent space while retaining essential features, and reconstructing the original data from this compressed representation to mitigate noise and enhance clarity.

With the simplified representations obtained from the VAE, we moved on to cluster analysis, seeking to identify underlying patterns within the data. Here, we employed a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), a versatile probabilistic framework capable of partitioning the data into distinct clusters based on their probabilistic distribution.

By leveraging the latent vectors generated by the VAE, the GMM effectively grouped the data into three distinct categories, each representing a unique configuration of features and characteristics within the satellite images.

In summary, our approach involved preprocessing the satellite image data, transforming it into tensors, applying a VAE-CNN model for dimensionality reduction and noise reduction, and utilizing a GMM for clustering analysis. This comprehensive methodology enabled us to gain valuable insights into the structure and patterns present within the satellite imagery.
